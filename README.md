- What is IBASAM?

IBASAM (Individual Based Atlantic Salmon Model) is an individual-based demo-genetic model developed to simulate S. salar population dynamics in southern European populations.

- How does IBASAM work?

The IBASAM model was developed in C++ and interfaced as a shared library for R (R Development Core, 2010) to make easy the statistical analyses of model outputs. The C++ source codes and R scripts to create and use the model as R package are available online on Github.

- How to use IBASAM?

[Installation procedure](docs/installation.md)

- What is IBASAM’ goal?

The integration into IBASAM of a demo-genetic structure coupled with the explicit representation of individual variability and complex life histories makes it a cohesive and novel tool to assess the effect of potential stressors on evolutionary demography of Atlantic salmon in further studies.
